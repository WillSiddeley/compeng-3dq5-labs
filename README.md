## Overview

This repository contains projects completed for the McMaster University course COMPENG 3DQ5. These projects were done between September 2021 and December 2021 and have been recently uploaded to my personal account.

## Course Description

COMPENG 3DQ5 is a course focused on digital systems design, including the implementation and verification of digital signal processing algorithms on hardware. Students gain hands-on experience with hardware description languages, simulation environments, and FPGA implementation.

## Projects Overview

### COE3DQ5 Project
The final project for COMPENG 3DQ5 involves designing and implementing a complex digital system that integrates multiple interfaces and peripherals. Specifically, the project includes:

- Creating a finite state machine (FSM) written in SystemVerilog to perform lossy decompression on a compressed image.
- Designing a custom digital circuit to perform Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), Upsampling, and Colorspace Conversion on the compressed image.
- Implementing a VGA controller in SystemVerilog to display the final image on a monitor.

Students are required to apply their knowledge of Verilog, SystemVerilog, and hardware design principles to create a functional system on the DE2-115 board. The project emphasizes the importance of design verification, requiring students to develop comprehensive testbenches to ensure the correctness of their designs. Additionally, students must document their design process and results, demonstrating their ability to communicate technical information effectively.

### Lab 5: Integrating SRAM, VGA and UART Interfaces
This lab provides experience with self-checking testbenches and designing digital systems synchronized to VGA and SRAM interfaces. Students also learn about the UART interface for transmitting image files from a PC to the DE2-115 board.

### Lab 4: Embedded Memories and an External SRAM Interface
Students build and simulate digital systems containing embedded memory blocks and an external SRAM interface. The lab emphasizes design verification using SystemVerilog testbenches and the ModelSim simulation environment.

### Lab 3: VGA Interface and Timing in Digital Systems
This lab focuses on designing and implementing a digital system synchronized with an external device. Students explore the VGA interface, which is the main display interface used for personal computers.

### Lab 2: Finite State Machine Design for the PS/2 and LCD Interfaces
Students learn the importance of finite state machines (FSMs) in digital systems design. The lab involves implementing digital systems using the PS/2 and LCD peripherals on the DE2-115 board.

### Lab 1: Introduction to Computer-Aided Design using Verilog
This lab introduces fundamental coding templates in Verilog for combinational and sequential logic circuits. Students gain experience with the Quartus design synthesis environment and the Modelsim simulation environment.
